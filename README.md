# TikTok-Shares-Botter
Adds TikTok Shares for you.

## Information
This tool was originally created by zoony1337. I have modified it to be cross-platform as his only works in Windows. This version works on any OS that can run Python 3.6+, Windows, Mac OS, Linux, etc. My plan is to keep working on this to add fancy stuff to cater to each OS, introduce runtime arguments, etc. as well as offer precompiled exes, dmgs, and tar.gzs and tie into init.d and systemd on Linux to periodically and repeatedly run on a schedule. That is, unless, TikTok patches this. Then none of that will happen. zoony1337 strictly developed to demonstrate how straightforward it is to abuse a service like TikTok. Usage of this tool will definitely cause the targeted video to be on the TikTok "For You" page — increases chances to become TikTok famous. Please refrain from using this TikTok Shares Botter as it is once again developed for educational purposes only. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk. You have been warned.

## Usage
- Python 3.6+ is required.
- Compatible with Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and wherever else you can run Python 3.6+.

1. Download Python and run the program:

### Windows
a. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest Python 3.x.  
b. Follow the installers instructions.  
c. Click the green "Clone" button and click "Download ZIP"  
d. Navigate to the download and extract the zip file.  
e. Double click on setup.py.  
f. Double click on main.py.  

### Mac OS
a. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest Python 3.x.  
b. Follow the installers instructions.  
NOTE: Mac OS comes preinstalled with an OLDER Python installation (Python 2.7) and will NOT work. Installing Python 3.x will install it alongside the Python 2.7 that is included with Mac OS and you must run it with 'python3' from the terminal.  
c. Click the green "Clone" button and click "Download ZIP"  
d. Navigate to the download and extract the zip file.  
e. Double click on setup.py.  
f. Double click on main.py.  

### Linux
> sudo apt install python3.7 python3-pip  
> git clone https://github.com/Brandon4466/TikTok-Shares-Botter.git  
> cd TikTok-Shares-Botter  
> python3 setup.py  
> python3 main.py  

2. Enter the amount of desired Shares.  
3. Paste a TikTok video URL — e.g. https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/1234567891234567891 (if it has a whole bunch of stuff after the numbers than just remove everything after the numbers, this will be programmed to be parsed out in a later release)  
4. All set!
